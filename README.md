# first-contributors-tut
A tutorial repo for teaching open source contributions to first timers

If you are new to Open Source Contrinution and probably not too conversant with git, then this is the repo for you.
All you have to do in this repo this add your name. What to do:

1. Fork this repo by clicking the fork icon. When this is done you will have 
    https://github.com/<your-username>/first-contributors-tut on your page instead of
    https://github.com/psalmskalu/first-contributors-tut
    
2. Clone the repo from your own pageOpen git bash on your computer (you must have git installed) and type
    $ git clone https://github.com/psalmskalu/first-contributors-tut
    
    This will download and save a local copy of the repo to your computer
    
3. Open the newly downloaded folder and open a git bash on that directory (folder).

4. Create a new branch to get ready for your changes. 
    $git checkout -b add-your-name
    
 5. Open the first-contributors.txt file from the downloaded project and add you name
 
 6. Save your changes by running the following commands:
    $ git add first-contributors.txt
    $ git commit -m "I just added my name"
    
 7. Push your changes to github:
    $ git push --set-upstream origin add-your-name
    
  8. Go to github and make a pull request.
  
  9. I will personally merge your PR almost immediately
  
  10. Voila! You have made your first Open Source contribution.
  
  
  Now, you didn't actually write any code. Don't worry. Contributing to Open Source isnt always about writing code. 
  But when you contribute to a project that actually involves writing code. It is still the same process.
  
  
  Thanks
